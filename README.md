# QAOA---Meta-Learning

This program is designed to observe the effects of meta-learning on QAOA problems. Meta-learning is done by an implementation of the Reptile algorithm developed by OpenAI. The QAOA solver code is an expansion of a program written by Tianchen Zhao, Giuseppe Carleo, James Stokes, and Shravan Veerapaneni, which may be seen here: https://github.com/Ericolony/QAOA

So far this code is able to solve MaxCut and Ising Model QAOA problems using the Python package NetKet.
