# QAOA---Meta-Learning

This program is designed to observe the effects of meta-learning on QAOA problems. The QAOA solver code is an expansion of a program written by Tianchen Zhao, Giuseppe Carleo, James Stokes, and Shravan Veerapaneni, which may be seen here: https://github.com/Ericolony/QAOA

Meta-learning is done by an implementation of the Reptile algorithm developed by Nichol, Achiam, and Schulman at OpenAI.

So far this code is able to solve MaxCut and Ising Model QAOA problems using the Python package NetKet.
